# Filename Manipulation Package #

This package includes a collection of functions and variables that can be used to work with the file system in a portable way. It includes functions for manipulating filenames, listing and manipulating directories, and finding well-known directories. It also has some uncategorized functions.
 
* [Manipulating Filenames](doc/filenames.md): Functions for manipulating filenames
* [Directory Functions](doc/dirfunctions.md): Functions for listing and manipulating directories
* [Directory Paths](doc/dirpaths.md): Paths to well-known directories
* [Miscellaneous](doc/misc.md): Uncategorized functions

When the package is loaded, it will also calculate some useful variables that show where different parts of the Torch system are installed. You should not change the values of these variables.
